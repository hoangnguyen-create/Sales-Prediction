# Sales Prediction
This project analyzes the impact of different advertising channels on product sales using exploratory data analysis and multiple linear regression modeling.

Data source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sca-programming-school/datasets/main/sales_advertising.csv

The dataset includes advertising spend across four channels:

* TV ads
* Radio ads
* Newspaper ads
* Digital marketing

**The objective is to identify which marketing channels significantly influence sales performance and to build a predictive model for estimating future sales based on advertising investments.**

**This project demonstrates practical experience in:**

Cleaned and validated dataset (handled missing values and outliers)

Conducted correlation analysis and visualization (heatmap)

Built and interpreted a multiple linear regression model

Evaluated predictive performance using R² and MSE

Generated data-driven marketing insights
