# Sales Prediction
This project analyzes the impact of different advertising channels on product sales using exploratory data analysis and multiple linear regression modeling.

Data source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sca-programming-school/datasets/main/sales_advertising.csv

The dataset includes advertising spend across four channels:

1. TV ads
2. Radio ads
3. Newspaper ads
4. Digital marketing

### **The objective is to identify which marketing channels significantly influence sales performance and to build a predictive model for estimating future sales based on advertising investments.**

**This project demonstrates practical experience in:**

* Cleaned and validated dataset (handled missing values and outliers)
* Conducted correlation analysis and visualization (heatmap)
* Built and interpreted linear regression model
* Evaluated predictive performance using R² and MSE
* Generated data-driven marketing insights
